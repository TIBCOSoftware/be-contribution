# TIBCO BusinessEventsÂ® Contribution

This repository is to add various contributions across different modules within TIBCO BusinessEvents. It will include contributions by TIBCO BusinessEvents team as well external users/customers/fields teams.

Below are some modules where contributions are available and/or can be added,

* [Store](https://github.com/tibco/be-contribution/tree/main/store) - Persistent store implementations.
* [Metric](https://github.com/tibco/be-contribution/tree/main/metric) - Metric store implementations.
* [Channel](https://github.com/tibco/be-contribution/tree/main/channel) - Channels implementations.
* [Catalog](https://github.com/tibco/be-contribution/tree/main/catalog) - Catalog functions implementations.

 ## Pre-requisites

 Some pre-requisites that generically apply to all contributions existing or new. If there are conflicts/changes/limitations, call them out in individual contribution README's.

 * Download/install Java and setup appropriate JAVA_HOME and PATH environment variables. Existing contributions use `Java 17`. So use Java 17 or above.

 * All contributions will be maven projects. Download/Install Maven and setup appropriate M2_HOME and PATH environment variables. Existing contribution use `Maven 3.9.6`. So use maven 3.9.6 or above.

 * Install docker, since most integration test will need to create a light throw away container.

 * Install `TIBCO BusinessEvents 6.3.x` and above.

 * Add necessary unit and/or integration tests for each contribution.

 ## Getting Started

 * Clone be-contribution repo,
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/tibco/be-contribution.git
 ```

 * Existing Contribution,

   - If you want to make any kind of changes around existing implementation and/or configuration, you can open the maven project into your choice of editor (Eclipse/IntelliJ/etc) and make appropriate changes. 

   - Follow the steps outlined in 'Building' section below to create a contribution jar.

 * New Contribution, 
 
   - First step will be to go through existing module specific pre-requite documents and contributions to get a sense of how they are implemented/structured/built.

   - Creat a new maven project. Add it as a child module to the parent module. E.g. `elasticsearch` metric contribution is marked as a sub module within '/metric/pom.xml'.

   - Finally follow the steps outlined in 'Building' to build the new contribution jar.
   

  ### Building

  Follow the below steps to build a contribution jar,

  * Once all changes for existing ones or for any new contributions are done. Edit root `pom.xml` file located under 'be-contribution',
    - Set `<be.home>` path to point to the TIBCO BusinessEvents installation home or pass it at command line while building the jar, ref below.
    - Any common third-party dependency version changes if needed.
    - Exclude any conflicting/duplicate jars off BusinessEvents and/or thirdparty dependencies from being packaged into the 'uber jar'. Some obvious ones are already excluded. Examples of conflicting/duplicate jars are BusinessEvents jars or common 3rd party ones like, jackson, httpclient, log4j, etc, these are already available under 'BE_HOME/lib/ext/tpcl', so it would be best to avoid packaging them again to prevent any class loading as well as jar size related issues.

  * Any contribution specific dependencies go in contribution specific `pom.xml` file.

  * Once done, open the command prompt, goto the the specific contribution folder('/modules-name/contribution-name') and run the maven command to build a new jar. E.g. passing the be.home path and skipping tests.
```
    cd /metric/elasticsearch
    mvn clean install -Dbe.home=/path/to/be/home -DskipTests
```
  
  * A new jar should be created under '/modules-name/contribution-name/target'. E.g. /metric/elasticsearch/target. You can then copy this jar to 'BE_HOME/lib/ext/tpcl/contrib' to make it available for use in BusinessEvents.
