# AWS SQS Channel

`AWS SQS` is a fully managed message queuing service. One can send, store, and receive messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available.

The mplementation provides support for injesting, processing incoming SQS messages into events consumed by BusinessEvents and converts events to outgoing SQS messages. 

## Pre-requisites

* Have a AWS SQS service up and running and necessary access/secret keys available.

## Getting Started

* Assuming you have gone through all the documentation and appropriate [steps](https://github.com/tibco/be-contribution/tree/main/channel) are followed to setup the new channel.
