# Contributing to TIBCO BusinessEvents® Contribution

Are you interested in contributing to TIBCO BusinessEvents® Contribution? If so, this doc was created specifically for you!

We’ve tried to make the code contribution process as easy as possible. After your first pull request, you’ll be prompted to sign the contributor license agreement (CLA); it’s easy and integrated right into GitHub. 

Before you begin, please take a look at the general guidelines below for contributing.

## How do I make a contribution?

Never made an open source contribution before? Wondering how contributions work in our project? Here's a quick rundown!

* Find an issue that you are interested in addressing or a feature that you would like to add. Look for issues labeled good first issue, kind/help-wanted
* Fork the repository associated with the issue to your local GitHub account. This means that you will have a copy of the repository under github-username/repository-name.
* Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/github-username/repository-name.git.
* Create a new branch for your fix using git checkout -b branch-name-here.
* Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the feature that you want to add.
* Use git add insert-paths-of-changed-files-here to add the file contents of the changed files to the "snapshot" git uses to manage the state of the project, also known as the index.
* Use git commit -m "Insert a short message of the changes made here" to store the contents of the index with a descriptive message.
* Push the changes to the remote repository using git push origin branch-name-here.
* Submit a pull request to the upstream repository.
* Give the pull request a title that very briefly identifies the changes made and includes the issue or bug number associated with your change.
* In the description field for the pull request, explain the changes that you made, any issues you think exist with the pull request you made, and any questions you have for the maintainers.
* Sign the CLA if you have not previously done so.
* Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer.
* Make changes to the pull request if the reviewing maintainer recommends them.
* Congratulations: You’ve contributed to BE Contributions! A celebration is in order!

## Best Practices for Code Contributions

If you're adding a new feature, such as a channel or store, please be sure to provide test cases for your feature. 

Refer to the [Documentation](https://tibcosoftware.github.io/be-contribution/) for more guidance and help.

If you have any questions, feel free to post an issue and tag it as a question, email be-contribution@tibco.com.

Don't forget, if you build an awesome Channel or Store you can [share your work via the BE Showcase](https://tibcosoftware.github.io/be-contribution)  your work via the BE Showcase rather than contributing to [be-contribution](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/be-contribution).
